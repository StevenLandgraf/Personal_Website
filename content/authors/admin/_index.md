    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Hi there, I'm Steven!

Iâ€™m an AI engineer, researcher, and general enthusiast for all things tech. I spend most of my time teaching neural networks to see the world (and occasionally to doubt themselves via uncertainty quantification), or collaborating with and supervising students on ambitious projects.

My research lives at the intersection of computer vision and metrology, with a focus on making AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and ultimately safer â€” across domains like remote sensing, robotics, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and industrial inspection.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact. Whether it's debugging a stubborn model, guiding a thesis to the finish line, or exploring new ideas over lunch, I genuinely enjoy working with others to push the boundaries of what machines can do for us.
