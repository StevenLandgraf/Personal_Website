      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hi there, I'm Steven!

Iâ€™m an AI engineer, researcher, and general enthusiast for all things tech. I spend most of my time teaching neural networks to see the world (and occasionally to doubt themselves via uncertainty quantification), or collaborating with and supervising students on ambitious projects.

My research lives at the intersection of computer vision and metrology, with a focus on making AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and ultimately safer â€” across domains like remote sensing, robotics, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and industrial inspection.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact. Whether it's debugging a stubborn model, guiding a thesis to the finish line, or exploring new ideas over coffee, I genuinely enjoy working with others to push the boundaries of what machines can do for us.
